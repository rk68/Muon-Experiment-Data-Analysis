# Muon-Experiment

Experimental Physics Lab Project

Title: Measuring the Muon Lifetime

Steps taken: 

1. Processing, cleaning data
2. Fitting the data to ensure linearity between FPGA and detector
3. Plotting muon data as histograms
4. Fitting exponential decay curve
5. Extrapolating the lifetime from the decay curve
6. Justifying cut-off point using chi-squared trade-offs
